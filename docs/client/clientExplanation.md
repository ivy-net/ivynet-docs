# Introduction

IvyNet is designed to simplify devops, compliance, and business development activities for node operators, allowing them to focus on managing their hardware, virtual environments, and delegated stake while retaining full control of the entire process.

## Client

The client consists of a shared suite of tools for node operators to manage their operations efficiently across deployments while retaining control. Key features will include:

- **Metrics Monitoring**: Continuously monitor system, performance, and health metrics of your nodes to ensure optimal productivity across deployments.
- **Network Adherance**: Keep your systems up to date and ensure your nodes remain in the active sets.
- **Logging**: Collect logs directly from your running services and store them in a database for easy querying via the interface or API.

The client operates as a daemon on all deployed machines, with a command line interface for user interactions.

## User Interface

The user interface is an easy to use webpage that helps optimize middle and back office tasks with a complete overview of your deployed and idle nodes. Features will include:

- **Metrics History**:  Access detailed historical metrics and data to analyze performance and generate operational, compliance, and business development reports.
- **Enhanced Metrics**: Benefit from network-specific inputs, data, and benchmarks to improve quality assurance and maintain competitiveness.
- **AI Diagnoses**: Use IvyNet's AI-powered diagnostics to identify issues in your nodes and receive actionable error-handling suggestions for quick resolution.
- **Organization Management**: Assign roles and manage access permissions for members of your organization.

IvyNet is built to make node operators' lives easier by offering as much information as possible to the operator.
