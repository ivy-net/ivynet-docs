# Ivynet Introduction

IvyNet is designed to simplify monitoring, deployment, and profitability operations for node operators, allowing them to focus on managing their hardware, virtual environments, and delegated stake while retaining full control of the entire process.

### Client

The Enterprise Client offers a suite of tools for node operators to manage their operations efficiently while retaining control. Key features include:

* **Automated Deployments and Update Scheduling**: streamline the deployment process and ensure your systems are always up-to-date with automatic or scheduled updates. 
* **Notification Systems**: Receive timely notifications for important events and updates, keeping you informed about the state of your nodes.
* **Health Monitoring**: Monitor the health of your nodes continuously to ensure optimal performance and quickly address any errors that pop up.

The client operates as a daemon on all deployed machines, with a command line interface for user interactions. 

### User Interface

The user interface is an easy to use webpage that gives a complete overview of your deployed and idle nodes. Features include:

* **Health Monitoring and History**: Access detailed health metrics and historical data to analyze the performance of your nodes over time.
* **Actively Validated Services (AVS) Overview**: View all available AVS options and their deployment requirements tailored to your delegated stake. 
* **Profitability Metrics**: Analyze historical and projected profitability metrics to optimize profitability.

IvyNet is built to make node operator's lives easier while retaining as much control as the operator demands, whether that is approval on every single decision the client makes, to automated switching of deployed nodes to a new AVS for higher profitability.
