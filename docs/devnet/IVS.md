# IVS - Symbiotic

[IVS](https://github.com/ivy-net/ivs) is a local Ethereum test/dev network dedicated to the restaking protocol [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/).
It is based on the [POS DevNet](https://github.com/ivy-net/eth-pos-devnet) repository but extended by an automatic deployment of the Symbiotic smart contracts.

## Scenarios review

The only scenario currently available is Symbiotic smart contract deployment, but more scenarios are under active development. Check back soon for more updates!
<!-- The contracts are deployed from a prearranged Docker image.
This method is cleaner than messing with the genesis block of an Anvil-based network.
It is a blank slate enabling testing deployments of the AVS smart contracts and other components of the solution in a private Proof of Stake network.
The same method can be used with an Anvil network.
Other scenarios add AVS-specific smart contracts, again deployed from a Docker image.
They also include off-chain components.
One of the scenarios contains extra monitoring components
That helps to familiarize with metrics available from an AVS. -->
