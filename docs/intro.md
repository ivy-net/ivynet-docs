# IvyNet Overview

### The Problem
The operational complexity of providing computing power to networks within restaking ecosystems has grown significantly relative to the status quo of Proof-of-Stake Layer 1 blockchains. Node operators are already having problems with the complexities introduced with restaking, including having to be constantly aware of minor upgrades, slashing risks, profitability, and many other intricacies on many orders of magnitude more systems. Simply put, with restaking's ability to lower the barriers of entry to building decentralized systems, many more hybrid-chains, dapp-chains, and super dapps will come online, and the complexity will quickly become unmanageable without an appropriate scaling solution.


### The Solution - IvyNet
IvyNet is a restaking middleware designed to empower decentralized node operators in maximizing the value of their resources within shared cryptoeconomic security systems, most notably, restaking protocols. With a focus on filling in the gap between node operators and the decentralized services they'll be running, IvyNet can increase productivity for node operators while allowing them to no longer put man hours into non-differentiating processes like deploying a specific AVS. Instead, they'll be able to focus on what sets their operators apart.
