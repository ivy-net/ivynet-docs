# IvyNet Overview

## The Problem

The operational complexity of providing computing power to networks within modern decentralized ecosystems has grown significantly relative to the status quo of first generation blockchains. Node operators are already having problems with the complexities introduced by restaking networks, DePIN, and AI, including having to be constantly aware of minor upgrades, high slashing risks, ever-changing profitability, and many other intricacies on orders of magnitude more systems. Simply put, with ever-lowering barriers of entry to building decentralized systems, many more chains, DePIN networks, and super-dapps will come online, and the complexity will quickly become unmanageable without an appropriate scaling and observability solution.

## The Solution - IvyNet

IvyNet is observability software designed to empower node operators to maximize the value of their resources within shared cryptoeconomic security systems, including restaking protocols, L1 blockchains, DePIN networks, and even eventual AI workloads. By helping to bridge the complexity gap between node operators and these decentralized services, IvyNet can provide enriched metrics, insights, and diagnostics across deployments to boost operator uptime and profitability. With IvyNet, node operators can more easily achieve operational excellence, gain business intelligence, and unlock new revenue opportunities with significantly less overhead. Instead of focusing on non-differentiating processes, node operators can concentrate on enhancing their core value propositions and delivering exceptional experiences to their end customers.
