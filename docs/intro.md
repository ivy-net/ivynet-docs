# IvyNet Overview

## The Problem

The operational complexity of providing computing power to networks within modern decentralized ecosystems has grown significantly relative to the status quo of first generation blockchains. Node operators are already having problems with the complexities introduced by restaking networks, DePIN, and AI, including having to be constantly aware of minor upgrades, high slashing risks, ever-changing profitability, and many other intricacies on orders of magnitude more systems. Simply put, with constantly lowering barriers of entry to building decentralized systems, many more chains and super-dapps will come online, DePIN networks will and the complexity will quickly become unmanageable without an appropriate scaling solution.

## The Solution - IvyNet

IvyNet is an observability middleware designed to empower decentralized node operators in maximizing the value of their resources within shared cryptoeconomic security systems, most notably DePIN networks, restaking protocols, and AI workloads. With a focus on filling in the gap between node operators and the decentralized services they'll be running, IvyNet can increase productivity for node operators while allowing them to no longer put man hours into non-differentiating processes like monitoring and deploying a specific AVS. Instead, they'll be able to focus on what sets their operators apart, while easily keeping a handle on what's going on within each of their nodes.
