### Hello from IvyNet

Hello, AVS!

IvyNet streamlines AVS management for your chosen node operators across by providing unified metrics and insights across their deployments.
We mutualize duplicative, non-differentiating efforts for both node operators and AVS teams across restaking ecosystems. 

In order to maximize the impact that IvyNet can have in optimizing your network operations, we have shared Deployment Recommendations below.
We also included an Integration Request [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf830Om9LRrXxyceAnKObAqXHfQg0kCoxsMLOMkgRbCOPnaPA/viewform?usp=header) to help accelerate our integration with your AVS.

Aside from that, we look forward to streamlining the management of your processes!

### Deployment Recommendations

- Include a Docker image downloaded from a centralized repository, eg: ghcr.io, as part of your AVS deployment flow
- Assign a unique name to your Docker image
- Expose a metrics port 
- Configure the metrics port to be exposed through bridge mode, not network mode host


### Integration Request

See integration request form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf830Om9LRrXxyceAnKObAqXHfQg0kCoxsMLOMkgRbCOPnaPA/viewform?usp=header).
It should take less than two minutes to fill out.
Also, if you are going to have an allowlist for your AVS, please include us in your testnet/Holesky set for our end-to-end testing:
